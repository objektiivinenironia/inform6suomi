! fialpha.h
! =========
! From Swedish Library by Fredrik Ramsberg, except the banner translation
! which is from verblibm (Library 611):
!
! Contains a Z-machine alphabet optimised for Swedish. 
! Must be included before any text in encoded, even before declaring 
! the constants Story and Headline.
!
! It is not absolutely necessary to include this file, but without it, 
! dictionary words containing "åäö" may be reduced to the 2-6 first 
! characters, rather than 9. This file is only relevant for Zcode games,
! not Glulx.
!
! If you don't agree with this Zcharacter directive, make your own instead. 
! Just make sure that åäö is included in the table, and that line 2 is an 
! upper case version of line 1.
